# Let-s-make-a-Wordle-Game-Clone-From-Scratch
In this repository there is all the code for the wordle game clone that video is on my YouTube channel Smok Codes 

You just need to put all the files in your editor and just run it in your browser.
Feel free to mess with the values and everything.

The dictionary and the target words file are not very important as i already pasted the whole file in the script.js file.

And

Keep Coding...
